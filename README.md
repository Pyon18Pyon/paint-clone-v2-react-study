# paint-clone-v2-react-study

This project was created in React after the completion of the Udemy course, [JavaScript Web Project: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-web-projects-to-build-your-portfolio-resume/).

During this course, the project was made with vanilla JavaScript so I rewrote the entire app in React.
The vanilla JavaScript version: [paint-clone-v1-javascript-study](https://github.com/Pyon18Pyon/paint-clone-v1-javascript-study).

## What it does?

This is a basic version of MS paint. We can see at the top that we have a toolbar with a series of icons for drawing, erasing, changing the color of brush and the background, changing the size of the brush, clearing the canvas, saving and deleting our drawing and even saving to an image file. 

## Key features

- Using the canvas HTML element to allow us to create a basic version of MS paint. 
- When hover over the **Clear** and **Clear Local Storage** buttons the color of the icons changes to red, which indicates that it is a destructive action. 
- Using localStorage functionality to save our drawings.
- On the left side of the top bar, it is intended to show which tool is active, either the brush or eraser. It also shows us some info when we click on one of other icons.
